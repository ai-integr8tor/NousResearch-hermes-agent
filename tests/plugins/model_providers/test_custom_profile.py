"""Unit tests for the custom provider profile's reasoning wiring.

``provider=custom`` covers any OpenAI-compatible endpoint the user points
Hermes at — local Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp, and hosted reasoning APIs like
GLM-5.2 on Volcengine ARK. Before #57601's salvage, ``CustomProfile`` emitted
nothing when reasoning was *enabled*, so a configured ``reasoning_effort``
was silently dropped for every custom endpoint.

These tests pin the wire-shape contract:
  - disabled            → extra_body.think = False
  - enabled + effort    → top-level reasoning_effort (native OpenAI-compat
                          format GLM/ARK expect), passed through verbatim
                          including ``max``/``xhigh``
  - enabled + no effort → nothing emitted (endpoint's server default applies)
  - ollama_num_ctx      → extra_body.options.num_ctx, orthogonal to reasoning
