"""Custom / Ollama (local) provider profile.

Covers any endpoint registered as provider="custom", including local
Ollama instances and OpenAI-compatible reasoning endpoints (GLM-5.2 on
Volcengine ARK, vLLM, llama.cpp). Key quirks:
  - ollama_num_ctx → extra_body.options.num_ctx (local context window)
  - reasoning_config disabled → extra_body.think = False
  - reasoning_config enabled + effort → top-level reasoning_effort
    (the native OpenAI-compatible format GLM/ARK expect; unset omits it
    so the endpoint's server default applies)
